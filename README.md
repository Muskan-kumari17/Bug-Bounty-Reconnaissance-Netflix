# Bug-Bounty-Reconnaissance-Netflix
In this project, we identify Netflix’s domains, subdomains, IP ranges, technologies, and publicly exposed services using legal and ethical reconnaissance techniques. Tools like Subfinder, Amass, Nmap, Dirb, and Wayback Machine are used to map Netflix’s attack surface and analyze its web infrastructure.


## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on the **reconnaissance phase of a bug bounty program** using Netflix as the target organization. Reconnaissance is the first step in ethical hacking, where publicly available information is collected to understand a company’s digital attack surface.

The project is conducted strictly for **educational and learning purposes**, following Netflix’s vulnerability disclosure policy.
