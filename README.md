# Bug-Bounty-Reconnaissance-Netflix
In this project, we identify Netflix’s domains, subdomains, IP ranges, technologies, and publicly exposed services using legal and ethical reconnaissance techniques. Tools like Subfinder, Amass, Nmap, Dirb, and Wayback Machine are used to map Netflix’s attack surface and analyze its web infrastructure.
